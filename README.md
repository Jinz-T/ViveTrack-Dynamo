# ViveTrack-Dynamo

ViveTrack is a [DynamoBIM](http://dynamobim.org/) package that allows real-time reading of HTC Vive spatial tracking data.

### Usage
If you have a working HTC Vive set, just download this package from Dynamo's package manager and look at the sample files.

In `01_Hello_Vive.dyn` you can find an example that tracks the position of all possible Vive objects and previews them in the background:

`02_Surface_Painting.dyn` uses controller tracking and trigger buttons to trace a series of lines in space and loft them into a surface, via the `DataRecorder` goodie:

Lejla's uses trackers to [move a virtual camera inside a Revit model](https://bim-me-up.com/index.php/2018/08/07/vivetrack-for-dynamo/) at Autodesk's VR Center in Munich.
